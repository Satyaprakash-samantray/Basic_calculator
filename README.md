# Basic Calculator Project

## Description
The Basic Calculator is a simple application that performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides an intuitive user interface to enter values and receive computed results.

## Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- User-friendly interface
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python/Java/Javascript (choose one based on implementation)
- GUI Framework: Tkinter (for Python), Swing (for Java), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for web-based implementation)
